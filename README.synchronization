Every table in anki contains a column named USN.

This usn is -1 if this object has been changed since the last
synchronization. In this case, this object must be synchronized toward
the server again.

Otherwise, the usn is an identifier of the date of the last
synchronization. If the usn of the same object is higher in ankiweb,
then this object is downloaded from ankiweb.
