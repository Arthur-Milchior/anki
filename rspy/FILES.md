As the file with [same name in parent directory](../FILES.md), this
document contains a succint description of the content of each file
from this folder.

This document contais the code allowing Python to call the rust
back-end. The time lost by communicating being theoritically smaller
than the time won by doing the computation in Python.

As far as my experience is, it's not actually the case, at least when
you need to do a lot of read query to the database.
