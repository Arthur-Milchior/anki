As the file with [same name in parent directory](../FILES.md), this
document contains a succint description of the content of each file
from this folder.

This directory contains tools used to create Anki's executable. It
does not contain code directly executed in Anki. In particular, it
contains the [list of hooks](hookslib.py), which gets compiled to the
[actual code used in anki](../anki/hooks.py).

The [diff sched](diff-sched.py) file deals with the difference between
both schedulers.
