prefix`, to add the same prefix to the deck name of all of those
cards. This ensure that they all belong to a same deck, while keeping
the same deck hierarchy. `Decks > Remove prefix` allows to remove this
common prefix and thus cancel the action `Add prefix`.

instead of deleting the note» chage the behavior of anki when he finds
a note which has no more card. This allow to lose the content of the
note, and let you correct the note instead to generate cards.
