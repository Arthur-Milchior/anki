# Differences with anki.
This files list the difference between regular anki and this forked
version. It also lists the different options in the Preferences's extra page.

## Limit the total number of cards seen today
In the preferences, you can check "Limit the total number of cards
seen by day in a deck". If you do so, in the deck's option's
configuration window, in the "general" tab, you can decide the maximal
number of cards you see in the deck. This put a limit on the sum of
both reviewed cards and new cards. So, the days where you have a lot
of cards to review, you'll have few or no new cards, and you'll have
more cards if you did have little to review.

A fourth number will thus be shown in the deck overview windows.
