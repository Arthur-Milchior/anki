# Differences with anki.
This files list the difference between regular anki and this forked
version. It also lists the different options in the Preferences's extra page.

## Add card: change note only if you ask for it (424778276)
Yeah, this description seems ridiculous. But actually, anki does not
respect this.

## Anki quicker (802285486)
Those modification makes anki quicker. Technical details are on the
add-on page.

## Edit new model without full sync (1988880085)

As long as you didn't sync your collection, you can add/remove/edit
field and card type to your new note types without having to do a full sync.

## Explain errors
You obtain more detailled error message if a sync fail, and if you try
do do a «Check database».

It transform the very long method `fixIntegrity` into plenty of small
function. It would helps to do add-ons for this forked version of anki.

In the preferences, the button «Note with no card: create card 1
instead of deleting the note» chage the behavior of anki when he finds
a note which has no more card. This allow to lose the content of the
note, and let you correct the note instead to generate cards.

## Export notes selected in the Browser (1983204951)
Selects some cards in the browser. Then `Cards>Export cards` allow you
to export the cards. This is similar to exporting a deck, except that
you have more fine control. You can essentially export anything that
you can query in the browser or that you can select.

Note that, if you export a deck, or a selection of cards, and that you
export cards, you are also exporting the notes of those
cards. However, some cards may be missing. When importing those cards,
the missing cards will be generated, and will be totally new. You may
lose data this way.  In the preference "Export siblings of exported
cards" allow you to avoid losing data, by exporting the siblings of
exported cards. The problem being, of course, that you may export
cards in decks you did not select. Thus, importing those cards may
potentially create more decks than expected.
